        theory: 'Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move. It focuses on concepts such as displacement (the change in position of an object, a vector quantity), velocity (the rate of change of displacement, specifying both speed and direction), and acceleration (the rate of change of velocity). For motion in one dimension with constant acceleration, a set of well-known equations of motion (e.g., v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², v² = u² + 2as) can be used to relate displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and time. Understanding graphical representations, such as position-time (x-t), velocity-time (v-t), and acceleration-time (a-t) graphs, is crucial for analyzing motion and deriving relationships between these quantities. For instance, the slope of an x-t graph gives velocity, and the slope of a v-t graph gives acceleration, while the area under a v-t graph gives displacement.'
