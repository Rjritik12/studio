It focuses on concepts such as displacement (the change in position of an object, a vector quantity), velocity (the rate of change of displacement, specifying both speed and direction), and acceleration (the rate of change of velocity).\n\nKey sub-topics for JEE include:\n- Motion in one dimension (rectilinear motion): This involves understanding average and instantaneous velocity/acceleration, the equations of motion for uniformly accelerated motion, and motion under gravity. Analyzing graphs of motion (x-t, v-t, a-t) is crucial.\n- Motion in two dimensions (planar motion): This extends concepts to vectors, including vector addition, subtraction, and resolution. Projectile motion is a key application, involving calculations of trajectory, time of flight, maximum height, and horizontal range. Understanding projectile motion on an inclined plane adds another layer of complexity. Relative velocity and relative acceleration in 2D are also important.\n- Calculus in kinematics: For non-uniformly accelerated motion, differentiation (v = dx/dt, a = dv/dt) and integration (Δx = ∫v dt, Δv = ∫a dt) are used to relate displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Problems often involve functions of time for these quantities.',

        theory: 'This section delves into Newton\'s foundational laws that govern the relationship between forces and motion. A thorough understanding of these laws is essential for solving a wide range of mechanics problems.\n\nKey topics include:\n- Newton\'s First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This law introduces the concept of inertial frames of reference and defines force qualitatively.\n- Newton\'s Second Law (F=ma): The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The direction of the acceleration is in the direction of the net force. This law is often applied to systems of connected bodies, pulleys, and problems involving variable mass (e.g., rockets) for advanced scenarios. Impulse (change in momentum) and the principle of conservation of linear momentum (if net external force is zero) are direct consequences.\n- Newton\'s Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. It\'s crucial to identify action-reaction pairs, which always act on different bodies.\n- Free Body Diagrams (FBDs): A systematic approach to problem-solving by isolating objects and representing all forces acting on them. FBDs are essential for correctly applying Newton\'s laws.\n- Equilibrium: Conditions for static equilibrium (object at rest, ΣF = 0) and dynamic equilibrium (object in uniform motion, ΣF = 0).\n- Friction: A force that opposes relative motion or tendency of relative motion between surfaces in contact. Types include static friction (limiting friction f_s_max = μ_s N), kinetic friction (f_k = μ_k N), and rolling friction. Understanding laws of friction, coefficient of friction, angle of friction, and angle of repose is important. Applications include block-on-block problems and motion on inclined planes.\n- Dynamics of Circular Motion: Analysis of forces causing uniform circular motion (centripetal force F_c = mv²/r) and non-uniform circular motion (tangential force in addition to centripetal).

        theory: 'This section explores the fundamental concepts of work, various forms of energy, power, and their conservation principles. These concepts provide powerful alternative methods for solving mechanics problems.\n\nKey concepts include:\n- Work Done by a Force: Work is done when a force causes displacement. For a constant force, W = F·d = Fdcosθ. For a variable force, W = ∫F·dx. Work can be positive, negative, or zero. Graphical interpretation involves the area under the F-x graph.\n- Kinetic Energy (K.E.): The energy possessed by an object due to its motion, K.E. = ½mv². \n- Work-Energy Theorem: The net work done on an object by all forces (conservative and non-conservative) equals its change in kinetic energy (W_net = ΔK.E.). This is a very powerful theorem.\n- Potential Energy (P.E. or U): Energy stored in an object or system due to its position or configuration. Potential energy is defined only for conservative forces. The change in potential energy is the negative of the work done by the conservative force (ΔU = -W_c).\n  - Gravitational Potential Energy: U_g = mgh (near Earth\'s surface, taking U=0 at h=0) or U_g = -GMm/r (general case, U=0 at r=∞).\n  - Elastic Potential Energy in a spring: U_s = ½kx², where k is the spring constant and x is the extension or compression.\n- Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces: \n  - Conservative forces: Work done is independent of the path taken and depends only on initial and final positions (e.g., gravitational force, spring force, electrostatic force). Work done in a closed loop is zero. Mechanical energy is conserved if only conservative forces are acting.\n  - Non-conservative forces: Work done depends on the path taken (e.g., friction, air resistance). Mechanical energy is not conserved; it may be dissipated as heat.\n- Conservation of Mechanical Energy: If only conservative forces are acting on a system, the total mechanical energy (K.E. + P.E.) of the system remains constant (K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f).\n- Modification with Non-conservative Forces: If non-conservative forces are present, W_nc = ΔK.E. + ΔP.E. = ΔE_mechanical.\n- Power: The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. Average power P_avg = ΔW/Δt. Instantaneous power P_inst = dW/dt = F·v (dot product of force and velocity). Units: Watt (W), Horsepower (hp).\n- Collisions: Interactions between two or more bodies for a short duration in which they exert relatively large forces on each other. \n  - Types: Elastic collisions (both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved) and Inelastic collisions (momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not; some K.E. is lost as heat, sound, etc.). Perfectly inelastic collision is when bodies stick together after collision.\n  - Coefficient of Restitution (e): A measure of the elasticity of a collision. e = (relative velocity of separation along the line of impact) / (relative velocity of approach along the line of impact). For perfectly elastic collision, e=1. For perfectly inelastic collision, e=0. For other inelastic collisions, 0 < e < 1.\n  - Collisions in one and two dimensions require application of conservation of linear momentum (component-wise in 2D).',

The concept of Electric Field (E) as a region where a charge experiences a force, and Electric Potential (V) as work done per unit charge. Electric field lines and equipotential surfaces help visualize fields. Electric dipoles and their behavior in fields are important. Gauss\'s law provides a powerful way to calculate electric fields for symmetric charge distributions. Conductors, insulators, and dielectrics modify electric fields.

Biot-Savart law calculates the magnetic field (B) due to current elements. Ampere\'s circuital law relates the line integral of B around a closed loop to the enclosed current, useful for symmetric current distributions (e.g., solenoid, toroid). The Lorentz force describes the force on a moving charge in combined electric and magnetic fields.

        theory: 'This unit covers the fundamental principles of heredity and variation, the molecular mechanisms underlying inheritance, and the processes of evolutionary change that have shaped life on Earth.\n\nPrinciples of Inheritance and Variation (Mendelian Genetics & Extensions):\n- Gregor Mendel\'s experiments with pea plants laid the foundation for genetics. His Laws of Inheritance include the Law of Dominance, Law of Segregation (purity of gametes), and Law of Independent Assortment.\n- Deviations from Mendelism: Incomplete dominance (e.g., flower color in Snapdragon where heterozygote shows intermediate phenotype), Co-dominance (e.g., ABO blood groups in humans where both alleles express themselves fully in heterozygote), Multiple alleles (more than two alleles for a gene, e.g., ABO blood groups), Pleiotropy (single gene affecting multiple phenotypic traits).\n- Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance (Sutton and Boveri): Proposed that genes are located on chromosomes, which undergo segregation and independent assortment.\n- Linkage and Recombination: Genes located on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together (linkage). Recombination (crossing over) during meiosis can break these linkages, leading to new combinations of alleles. The frequency of recombination is related to the distance between genes.\n- Sex Determination: Mechanisms vary (e.g., XX/XY in humans and Drosophila, ZZ/ZW in birds, X0 in some insects, haplo-diploidy in honey bees).\n- Pedigree Analysis: Studying inheritance patterns in human families using family trees.\n- Genetic Disorders: \n  - Mendelian disorders: Caused by alteration in a single gene (e.g., Autosomal dominant - Myotonic dystrophy; Autosomal recessive - Sickle-cell anemia, Phenylketonuria, Cystic fibrosis, Thalassemia; X-linked - Haemophilia, Colour blindness).\n  - Chromosomal disorders: Caused by absence, excess, or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes (e.g., Aneuploidy - Down’s syndrome (Trisomy 21), Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY), Turner’s syndrome (XO)).\n\nMolecular Basis of Inheritance:\n- Search for Genetic Material: Experiments by Griffith, Avery-MacLeod-McCarty, and Hershey-Chase established DNA as the primary genetic material.\n- Structure of DNA: Watson and Crick\'s double helix model. DNA is a polymer of deoxyribonucleotides. Chargaff\'s rules (A=T, G=C; A+G = T+C). Antiparallel strands.\n- DNA Replication: Semi-conservative process (Meselson-Stahl experiment).

Darwinism (Theory of Natural Selection - key concepts: overproduction, struggle for existence, variations, survival of the fittest/natural selection). Mutation Theory (Hugo de Vries - emphasized mutations as source of variation).\n- Modern Synthetic Theory of Evolution (Neo-Darwinism): Combines Darwinian natural selection with modern genetics (mutations, recombination, gene flow, genetic drift).\n- Hardy-Weinberg Principle: Describes a non-evolving population (allele and genotype frequencies remain constant generation after generation) under specific conditions (large population, random mating, no mutation, no gene flow, no natural selection). Equation: p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p + q = 1.

        theory: 'This chapter introduces the system of real numbers, building upon previous knowledge of number systems like natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, and rational numbers. It formalizes concepts like Euclid’s division algorithm and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which are crucial for number theory.\n\nKey concepts include:\n- Euclid’s division lemma: For any two positive integers \'a\' (dividend) and \'b\' (divisor), there exist unique integers \'q\' (quotient) and \'r\' (remainder) satisfying the relation a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < b. This lemma states that any positive integer \'a\' can be divided by another positive integer \'b\' in such a way that it leaves a remainder \'r\' that is smaller than \'b\'.\n- Euclid’s division algorithm: This is a technique to compute the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two given positive integers. It is based on Euclid’s division lemma. The algorithm involves repeatedly applying the lemma until the remainder becomes zero. The divisor at this stage is the HCF of the two numbers.\n- Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every composite number can be expressed (factorized) as a product of prime numbers, and this factorization is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur. This theorem is used to find the HCF and LCM (Least Common Multiple) of numbers using the prime factorization method. (HCF = product of the smallest power of each common prime factor in the numbers. LCM = product of the greatest power of each prime factor involved in the numbers).\n- Revisiting Irrational Numbers: Proofs demonstrating the irrationality of numbers like √2, √3, √5, typically using the method of contradiction. Understanding that the sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational, and the product or quotient of a non-zero rational and an irrational number is irrational.\n- Revisiting Rational Numbers and Their Decimal Expansions: A rational number is a number that can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers, q ≠ 0, and p and q are co-prime. This section explores the conditions for a rational number to have a terminating decimal expansion or a non-terminating repeating (recurring) decimal expansion. A rational number has a terminating decimal expansion if and only if the prime factorization of its denominator (q, in simplest form) is of the form 2^n * 5^m, where n and m are non-negative integers. Otherwise, it has a non-terminating repeating decimal expansion.',

Sign of m indicates nature of image (negative for real & inverted, positive for virtual & erect).\n  - New Cartesian Sign Convention: Crucial for applying mirror and lens formulas correctly (distances measured from pole, against incident light are negative, along incident light are positive; heights above principal axis are positive, below are negative).\n- Refraction of Light: The phenomenon of bending of light when it travels obliquely from one transparent medium to another, due to the change in the speed of light in different media.\n  - Laws of Refraction:\n    1. The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n    2. Snell’s Law: The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for a given pair of media and for light of a given color. This constant is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first (n₂₁).  sin i / sin r = n₂₁ = n₂/n₁ = v₁/v₂.\n  - Refractive Index (n): A measure of how much light bends or slows down in a medium. Absolute refractive index of a medium (n) = speed of light in vacuum (c) / speed of light in medium (v). Denser medium has higher n, rarer medium has lower n. Light bends towards normal when going from rarer to denser, and away from normal when going from denser to rarer.\n  - Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab: Light emerges parallel to the incident ray but is laterally displaced.\n- Spherical Lenses: A transparent refracting medium bounded by two spherical surfaces or one spherical and one plane surface.\n  - Types: Convex lens (thicker at center, thinner at edges; converging lens) and Concave lens (thinner at center, thicker at edges; diverging lens).\n  - Important Terms: Optical Centre (O - central point of lens), Principal Axis, Principal Foci (F₁, F₂ - two foci for lenses), Focal Length (f - distance OF).\n  - Ray Diagrams for Image Formation by Lenses: Similar principles as mirrors, using standard rays to locate images.\n  - Lens Formula: 1/v - 1/u = 1/f.\n  - Magnification (m): m = h_i/h_o = v/u.\n  - Power of a Lens (P): The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens. P = 1/f (where f is focal length in meters). Unit: Dioptre (D). Power is positive for convex lens, negative for concave lens.',

        theory: 'This chapter deals with the fundamental processes that are essential for maintaining life and ensuring the survival of living organisms. These vital processes include nutrition, respiration, transportation, and excretion.\n\nKey life processes covered:\n- Nutrition: The process by which an organism takes in food (nutrients), digests it, absorbs it, and utilizes it for energy, growth, repair, and maintenance.\n  - Modes of Nutrition:\n    - Autotrophic Nutrition: Organisms synthesize their own organic food from simple inorganic raw materials (e.g., CO₂, H₂O) using an external energy source. Green plants are primary autotrophs, performing photosynthesis (using light energy). Equation: 6CO₂ + 12H₂O --(Sunlight, Chlorophyll)--> C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6H₂O + 6O₂. Key events: absorption of light by chlorophyll, conversion of light to chemical energy & splitting of water, reduction of CO₂ to carbohydrates. Site: Chloroplasts.\n    - Heterotrophic Nutrition: Organisms obtain pre-synthesized organic food from other organisms. Types: Holozoic (ingesting solid food, e.g., Amoeba, humans), Saprophytic (feeding on dead and decaying organic matter, e.g., fungi, some bacteria), Parasitic (deriving nutrition from a living host, causing harm, e.g., Cuscuta (amarbel), tapeworms, lice).\n  - Nutrition in Amoeba: A unicellular organism with holozoic nutrition involving phagocytosis (ingestion), formation of food vacuole, digestion by enzymes, absorption, assimilation, and egestion.\n  - Nutrition in Human Beings: Involves the human digestive system (alimentary canal: mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, anus; associated glands: salivary glands, liver, pancreas). Mechanical and chemical digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats by various enzymes (e.g., amylase, pepsin, trypsin, lipase) at different parts of the alimentary canal. Absorption of digested food primarily in the small intestine (villi increase surface area).\n- Respiration: The biochemical process of releasing energy from assimilated food, typically by the oxidation of glucose. This energy is usually stored in ATP molecules. It occurs in all living cells.\n  - Types: Aerobic Respiration (occurs in the presence of oxygen, complete breakdown of glucose into CO₂, H₂O, and a large amount of energy - approx. 38 ATP per glucose). Anaerobic Respiration (occurs in the absence of oxygen, incomplete breakdown of glucose, yields much less energy). \n    - Pathways of Glucose Breakdown: Glycolysis (in cytoplasm, common to both, produces pyruvate). Fate of pyruvate depends on O₂ availability: \n      - Aerobic: Pyruvate enters mitochondria → Krebs cycle → Electron Transport Chain.\n      - Anaerobic in Yeast (Fermentation): Pyruvate → Ethanol + CO₂ + Energy (2 ATP).\n      - Anaerobic in Muscle Cells (during strenuous activity): Pyruvate → Lactic Acid + Energy (2 ATP).\n  - Human Respiratory System: Organs (nasal passage, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, lungs). Mechanism of Breathing (inhalation and exhalation) facilitated by diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Gaseous Exchange: Diffusion of O₂ from alveoli to blood, and CO₂ from blood to alveoli. Transport of O₂ (mainly by hemoglobin in RBCs) and CO₂ (as bicarbonate, carbaminohemoglobin, dissolved in plasma).\n- Transportation: The process of carrying absorbed or synthesized substances from one part of the body to others.\n  - Transportation in Human Beings: By the circulatory system.\n    - Blood: Fluid connective tissue (Plasma, RBCs, WBCs, Platelets). Functions: transport, protection, regulation.\n    - Heart: Muscular, four-chambered organ that pumps blood. Double circulation (blood passes through heart twice in one complete cycle: pulmonary circulation - heart to lungs & back; systemic circulation - heart to body & back).\n    - Blood Vessels: Arteries (carry blood away from heart), Veins (carry blood towards heart), Capillaries (fine vessels for exchange).\n    - Lymph: Tissue fluid in lymphatic vessels. Helps in transport and defense.\n  - Transportation in Plants:\n    - Transport of Water and Minerals: By Xylem tissue. Absorption by roots (osmosis, active transport). Upward movement (ascent of sap) due to root pressure and mainly transpiration pull (cohesion-tension theory).\n    - Transport of Food (Translocation): By Phloem tissue. Movement of sugars (sucrose) from leaves (source) to other parts (sink) like roots, fruits, storage organs.\n- Excretion: The biological process of removing harmful metabolic waste products from the body.\n  - Excretion in Human Beings: By the excretory system (Kidneys, Ureters, Urinary Bladder, Urethra).\n    - Nephron: Functional unit of the kidney. Structure: Bowman\'s capsule, Glomerulus, Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT), Loop of Henle, Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT), Collecting Duct.\n    - Mechanism of Urine Formation: 1. Glomerular Filtration (ultrafiltration of blood in glomerulus). 2. Selective Reabsorption (useful substances like glucose, amino acids, salts, water reabsorbed from filtrate in tubules). 3. Tubular Secretion (waste products like urea, K⁺, H⁺ actively secreted into filtrate).\n    - Artificial Kidney (Hemodialysis): Used in case of kidney failure.\n  - Excretion in Plants: Plants use varied strategies. Gaseous wastes (CO₂ from respiration, O₂ from photosynthesis) removed through stomata and lenticels. Excess water removed by transpiration. Other wastes stored in vacuoles, dead cells (e.g., old xylem as resins/gums), or shed in falling leaves/bark. Some wastes excreted into the soil.',

        theory: 'Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. It involves designing, writing, testing, and maintaining source code, which is then translated into machine code that the computer can execute.\n\nKey introductory concepts include:\n- What is a Program?: A program is a sequence of instructions written to perform a specified task with a computer. These instructions are written in a programming language.\n- Programming Languages: These are formal languages designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. They are used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.\n  - Low-level Languages: These are closer to the computer\'s hardware and provide little or no abstraction from a computer\'s instruction set architecture. Examples include Machine Code (binary) and Assembly Language. They are harder for humans to read and write but offer precise control over hardware.\n  - High-level Languages: These use natural language elements, are easier to use, read, and maintain, and are more abstract from the hardware details. Examples include Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, C#. They often require a compiler or interpreter to be translated into machine code.\n- Translators (Compilers and Interpreters):\n  - Compiler: A program that translates the entire source code of a program written in a high-level language into machine code (or another lower-level language) all at once, creating an executable file. This executable can then be run independently. Examples: C, C++, Java (compiles to bytecode).\n  - Interpreter: A program that reads a high-level program statement by statement, translates it into machine code, and executes it immediately before moving to the next statement. No separate executable file is created. Examples: Python, JavaScript (often interpreted in browsers).\n- Algorithm: A step-by-step, unambiguous procedure or formula for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. Algorithms are the logical foundation of any program. They must be finite and well-defined.\n- Flowchart: A diagrammatic representation of an algorithm or a workflow. It uses standard symbols to represent different types of instructions (e.g., start/end, process, decision, input/output) and arrows to show the flow of control. Flowcharts help in visualizing and understanding the logic of a program before coding.\n- Input/Output (I/O): Most programs interact with the user or other systems. Input refers to data received by the program (e.g., user typing on a keyboard, reading from a file). Output refers to data sent out by the program (e.g., displaying on screen, writing to a file).',

        theory: 'Variables are fundamental to programming as they are used to store and manage data that a program can manipulate. Data types specify the kind of values a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on those values.\n\nKey concepts:\n- Variables: A variable is a symbolic name or identifier that refers to a storage location in the computer\'s memory where a data value can be stored and retrieved. The value stored in a variable can typically be changed during program execution.\n  - Declaration: In many statically-typed languages (like Java, C++), a variable must be declared before use, specifying its name and data type (e.g., `int age;`). Some dynamically-typed languages (like Python) don\'t require explicit type declaration; the type is inferred at runtime.\n  - Assignment (Initialization): Giving a variable a value (e.g., `age = 25;`). Initialization is assigning the first value.\n  - Naming Conventions: Rules and best practices for naming variables to make code readable and maintainable (e.g., start with a letter or underscore, cannot be a keyword, use camelCase or snake_case, be descriptive).\n- Data Types: Define the nature of the data a variable can hold, such as whether it\'s a number, text, or a true/false value. This determines the memory allocated and the operations allowed.\n  - Integers (e.g., `int`, `short`, `long` in C++/Java; `int` in Python): Represent whole numbers (e.g., 10, -3, 0). Different integer types might have different size ranges.\n  - Floating-point numbers (e.g., `float`, `double` in C++/Java; `float` in Python): Represent numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form (e.g., 3.14159, -0.002, 2.7e5).\n  - Characters (e.g., `char` in C++/Java): Represent single characters, typically enclosed in single quotes (e.g., \'a\', \'%\', \'7\').\n  - Strings (e.g., `String` in Java, `std::string` in C++, `str` in Python): Represent sequences of characters, typically enclosed in double or single quotes (e.g., "Hello World!", "Python is fun").\n  - Booleans (e.g., `boolean` in Java, `bool` in C++/Python): Represent logical values, typically `true` or `false`.\n- Type Casting/Conversion: The process of changing a variable from one data type to another.\n  - Implicit Conversion (Coercion): Automatic conversion performed by the compiler/interpreter when types are compatible and the conversion is safe (e.g., converting an `int` to a `float`).\n  - Explicit Conversion (Casting): Manual conversion performed by the programmer using specific syntax (e.g., `(int)someFloatValue;` in C++/Java, `int(someFloatValue)` in Python).\n- Constants and Literals:\n  - Literals: Fixed values directly written in the source code (e.g., the number `100`, the string `"Data"`).\n  - Constants: Variables whose values cannot be changed after they are initialized. Declared using keywords like `const` (C++, JavaScript) or `final` (Java).\n- Scope of Variables: Determines where in the program a variable can be accessed.\n  - Local Scope: Variable declared inside a function or block, accessible only within that function/block.\n  - Global Scope: Variable declared outside all functions, potentially accessible throughout the program (use with caution).',

        theory: 'Control flow statements, particularly conditional statements, allow a program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are met. This enables programs to respond dynamically to different inputs or situations.\n\nKey concepts:\n- Conditional Statements: These are programming constructs that execute a specific block of code if a condition is true, and optionally, another block if the condition is false.\n  - `if` statement: The most basic conditional statement. It evaluates a boolean condition. If the condition is true, the block of code immediately following the `if` statement is executed. If false, the block is skipped.\n    Syntax (general): `if (condition) { // code to execute if condition is true }`\n  - `else if` (or `elif` in Python) statement: Used to check additional conditions if the preceding `if` or `else if` conditions were false. There can be multiple `else if` blocks. The first `else if` whose condition is true will have its code block executed, and the rest are skipped.\n    Syntax (general): `else if (another_condition) { // code if another_condition is true }`\n  - `else` statement: Provides a default block of code to execute if none of the preceding `if` or `else if` conditions are true.\n    Syntax (general): `else { // code to execute if all above conditions are false }`\n- Nested `if` statements: An `if`, `else if`, or `else` block can contain another set of conditional statements. This allows for more complex, multi-level decision-making logic.\n- Switch-Case Statement (found in languages like C, C++, Java, C#; Python uses if/elif/else chains or dictionaries for similar functionality): A multi-way branching statement that evaluates an expression against a list of constant values (cases). When a match is found, the code block associated with that case is executed. A `break` statement is often needed to exit the switch after a case is executed. A `default` case can be included if no other case matches.\n- Relational Operators: Used to compare two values.
