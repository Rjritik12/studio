        theory: 'Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move. It focuses on concepts such as displacement (the change in position of an object, a vector quantity), velocity (the rate of change of displacement, specifying both speed and direction), and acceleration (the rate of change of velocity). For motion in one dimension with constant acceleration, a set of well-known equations of motion (e.g., v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², v² = u² + 2as) can be used to relate displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and time. Understanding graphical representations, such as position-time (x-t), velocity-time (v-t), and acceleration-time (a-t) graphs, is crucial for analyzing motion and deriving relationships between these quantities. For instance, the slope of an x-t graph gives velocity, and the slope of a v-t graph gives acceleration, while the area under a v-t graph gives displacement.'

Nutrition in human beings: human digestive system (alimentary canal and digestive glands), process of digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\n- Respiration: Process of releasing energy from food. Types: aerobic (in presence of oxygen) and anaerobic (in absence of oxygen). Breakdown of glucose by various pathways. Human respiratory system: structure and function. Mechanism of breathing. Gaseous exchange in plants (stomata) and animals.\n- Transportation: Movement of substances from one part of the body to another. Transportation in human beings: blood (composition and functions), heart (structure and pumping mechanism), blood vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries), double circulation, lymphatic system. Transportation in plants: transport of water (xylem), transport of food (phloem - translocation).\n- Excretion: Process of removal of metabolic waste products from the body. Excretion in human beings: human excretory system (kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra), structure of nephron, mechanism of urine formation. Excretion in plants: removal of gaseous wastes, other wastes (resins, gums, stored in old xylem, falling leaves).'
